#text input abstraction

= Introduction =

gTextStream (defined in gtextstream.h) is a text input abstraction layer which allows gParses tokenizer to tokenize either from files or from memory. 

=== gStreamFromMemory ===

Creates a stream from a memory buffer. If owner is set to true, the memory will be freed with the stream is freed.

{{{gTextStream *gStreamFromMemory(char *memory, int length, bool owner)}}}

Parameters:
  * memory - Pointer to the text to be streamed
  * length - Length of the memory buffer
  * owner  - If this is set to true, gFreeStream will free the memory buffer
Returns:
  Pointer to the gTextStream created or NULL on error.


=== gStreamFromFilename ===

Opens a text file of the given name and loads a skin from it.

{{{gTextStream *gStreamFromFilename(const char *filename)}}}

Parameters:
  * filename - Pointer to a string containing the name of the file to stream.
Returns:
  Pointer to the gTextStream created or NULL on error.


=== gFreeStream ===
Frees the given stream. If the stream is a memory buffer, the memory is freed. If the stream is a file, the filestream is clused. This function should always be used to free gTextStream structs.

{{{#define gFreeStream(stream)  stream->freestream(stream)}}}

Parameters:
  * stream - The gTextStream you want to free.
Return:
  None.
