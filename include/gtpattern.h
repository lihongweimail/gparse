/**
 * \file gtpattern.h
 * \brief Contains definitions and prototypes for token pattern processing.
 *
 * A 'token pattern' is a set of instructions that operate based on a stream of
 * tokens. The 'token processor' steps through the instruction set using the
 * output of op codes as conditions. Each step has an op code that either
 * returns true or false and each step has codes for both cases. The token
 * processor has an exection stack which can be pushed and poped, and a list
 * of stored tokens which hook functions can then read specific input from
 * without having to wade through all the tokens to get them.
